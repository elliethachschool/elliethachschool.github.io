# Arithmetic Expression Evaluator

#### Fall 2024, Software Engineering 1 Group Project
---

Worked as part of a team to build an arithmetic expression evaluator that can read and calculate mathematical expressions from text. The tool supports operator precedence, parentheses, and all standard arithmetic operations, turning text input into accurate results. We designed and implemented a custom parser and calculation engine from scratch, handling nested operations and mixed operators. This project demonstrates practical problem-solving, teamwork, and the ability to turn mathematical logic into working code—a mini calculator created entirely by our group.

## Why It Matters

This project matters because it turns abstract mathematical expressions into precise results, showing how logic and algorithms can directly solve real-world problems. Building the evaluator from scratch gave us hands-on experience with parsing, computation, and handling complex rules like operator precedence—skills that are essential for software development, data processing, and any application that relies on interpreting structured input. Beyond the technical side, it highlights teamwork, problem-solving, and the ability to create tools that make complicated tasks simpler and more reliable.
