Worked as part of a team to develop Quash, a custom command-line shell built from scratch to mimic the behavior of Bash. Our shell supports executing programs, passing arguments, handling input/output redirection, and managing processes, providing a lightweight but fully functional terminal experience. Building it involved low-level programming, careful process management, and designing robust handling for user commands and system interactions. This project gave us hands-on experience with operating system concepts and collaborative software development, demonstrating both technical skills and teamwork in creating a tool that interacts directly with the system at a fundamental level.

The GitHub repository for 'Quash Shell' was asked to be private by the instructor.

## Why It Matters

This project matters because it gives hands-on experience with how operating systems work at a fundamental level, from process management to input/output handling. By building a shell from scratch, we learned how programs interact with the system, how commands are parsed and executed, and how to handle errors and edge cases—skills that are essential for system-level programming, software engineering, and understanding the backbone of computing. Beyond the technical side, it demonstrates teamwork, problem-solving, and the ability to turn complex OS concepts into a working, user-facing tool.
